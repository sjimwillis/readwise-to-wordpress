Python script that I call from cron each night to pull all the highlights and notes I made that day into my wordpress blog. Each article gets its own entry.
I use a category ID to keep them seperate from my main blog page.
script writes the date of last run to a config file in your home dir when you run it (so that it knows the last time it ran)

paired with dowpy script this also then pulls all of my highlights/note into my Day One Journal.

Here's how the posts show up on my site:
